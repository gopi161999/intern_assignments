 i learned some html tags,Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the elements <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.The <p> tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of text should go in between an opening <p> and a closing </p> tag. Whenever you use the <br /> element, anything following it starts from the next line. This tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them. The <title> tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab. The <u> tag represents some text that is unarticulated and styled differently from normal text, such as misspelled words or proper names in Chinese text. The content inside is typically displayed with an underline. You can change this with CSS (see example below). The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
 
 i learned something about propositions Maria has a blue dog. Kevin has a purple cat. Joann has a black rat. These are examples of propositions. Propositions, in logic, are statements that can be labeled as either true or false. All of the examples you just heard and saw are complete statements that you can say are either true or false. In logic, we sometimes change our original statement to its negative form. We do this by adding a NOT in the statement. So, the negative of 'Maria has a blue dog' is 'Maria does not have a blue dog.' We've added a few words just to make it grammatically correct, but as you can see, we have added a NOT in the statement. We went from stating that something is happening to something that is not happening. A proposition is a statement that is either true or false. In our course, we will usually call a mathematical proposition a theorem.
