Day 16


  i learned somethig called object in js, In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object. Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword), Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword), Dates are always objects, Maths are always objects, Regular expressions are always objects, Arrays are always objects, Functions are always objects, Objects are always objects
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.
example
        const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
  i learned something called basic concepts of ui/ux/wf, The “UI” in UI design stands for “user interface.” The user interface is the graphical layout of an application. It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields, and all the rest of the items the user interacts with. This includes screen layout, transitions, interface animations and every single micro-interaction. Any sort of visual element, interaction, or animation must all be designed. “UX” stands for “user experience.” A user’s experience of the app is determined by how they interact with it. Is the experience smooth and intuitive or clunky and confusing? Does navigating the app feel logical or does it feel arbitrary? Does interacting with the app give people the sense that they’re efficiently accomplishing the tasks they set out to achieve or does it feel like a struggle? User experience is determined by how easy or difficult it is to interact with the user interface elements that the UI designers have created. A wireframe is a two-dimensional illustration of a page’s interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors. For these reasons, wireframes typically do not include any styling, color, or graphics. Wireframes also help establish relationships between a website’s various templates. i found variation of js complier higher version to lower version, the sort function is executed in lower version (only certain condition), but it is not executed in the higher version. after that learned something called array in js The every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value, And next Array.find() which can produce the particular which can satisfied certain condition, then Array.filter() which can used to filter the array based on certain condition, The toString() method returns a string representing the objectBy default toString() takes no parameters. However, objects that inherit from Object may override it with their own implementation that do take parameters. For example, the toString() methods implemented by Number and BigInt take an optional radix parameter.ou can create a function to be called in place of the default toString() method. The toString() function you create must return a primitive. If it returns an object and the method is called implicitly (i.e. during type conversion or coercion), then its result will be ignored and the value of a related method, valueOf(), will be used instead, or a TypeError will be thrown if none of these methods return a primitive.
